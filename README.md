# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a basic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using React.

## Game Mechanics

- Players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' in a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to place three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all squares are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
